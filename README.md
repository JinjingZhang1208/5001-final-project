#Language: Python


## Introduction

Welcome to the classic Snake game! In this project, you control a snake on the screen and aim to score points by guiding it to eat randomly appearing food. But be careful, hitting the wall or your snake's own body will end the game. The challenge increases as your snake grows longer with each food consumption.

The game displays your current score and keeps track of your best score, saving it in a file.


## Files Overview

- `main.py`: Run this file to play the game and experience the core game logic.
- `elements.py`: Defines the Snake and Food classes, representing game elements.
- `score_manager.py`: Manages the player's score during the game, including saving and loading the best score. Best score is stored in `data.txt`.
- `test_elements.py`: Contains unit tests for the Snake and Food classes.
- `test_score.py`: Holds tests for the save_best_score_to_file and load_best_score_from_file functions in the Score class. You can also evaluate the Score class by playing the game.

## Getting Started
