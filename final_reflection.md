Final Reflection
--------------------------
STUDENT: Jinjing Zhang
SEMESTER: Spring 2023


At first, I thought writing any game codes at my current level would be extremely hard. I accidentally know the Turtle package which would be useful to create 2D games like Snake or Pong. Then I thought I would try the snake game since it was one of the first games I played on my cell phone. I learned how to make the objects move on the screen.

I like this project a lot because it is the first project that I turn it on the screen. Before I could only use idle or pycharm to run the codes. I did not know how far it was from my Pyhont knowledge of the practical world. After digging for this final project(learned a bit about Flask) and finishing the snake game, I have this great achievement from what I have learned in this course. 

There was challenging completing this project. I read the turtle graphics from Python Documentation and tried different arrangements to find the correct order and usage of some of the functions. The most difficult part is the order of all the codes. Flowcharts are helpful, but still, This required a lot of trial and error and patience. Glad that I finally got the snake game.


I definitely will try using Flask to make one of my old homework(probably the star rating). Moreover, I am interested to try more packages other than Turtle. Through this final project, I gain confidence in future learning in computer science. It is still manageable.
